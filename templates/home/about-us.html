            <p>
                <strong>Welcome to LVDrive</strong>, where luxury meets freedom on four wheels.<br>
                We’re not just redefining the way people drive — we’re transforming how they experience luxury.
            </p>
    
            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
                LVDrive is a premium car-sharing platform that connects passionate drivers with owners of high-end, luxury vehicles.
                Whether you're looking to <strong>borrow</strong> an extraordinary ride for a weekend getaway, or want to <strong>lend</strong> your exclusive car and earn income from it — LVDrive is the place where opportunity and elegance meet.
